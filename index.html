                   <h1>Git Quiz  </h1>
    <h4> What is Git and why is it so important? </h4>
    <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>
    <h4> What's a branch and why do we create them? </h4>
    <p>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.</p>
    <h4> What is the Working Tree? </h4>
    <p>The working tree is the set of all files and folders a developer can add, edit, rename and delete during application development. The status command can provide insight into how the Git working tree behaves. More colloquially, developers often refer to the Git working tree as the workspace or the working directory.</p>
    <h4>  What's the staging area? </h4>
    <p>The staging area can be described as a preview of your next commit. When you create a git commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make them as a new commit. You are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging area. The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the changes.</p>
    <h4> What's the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve? </h4>
    <p>git fetch</p>
